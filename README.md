Bootstrap To-Top Feature
========================

This shows how to add a simple to-top feature to your website based on Bootstrap framework.

Additional code is inside `main.css` and `main.js` files. Read `to-top.html` to see how to use it.

It is responsive which means the to-top button will not display on devices with small screens to avoid blocking your content.

It is beautiful.
